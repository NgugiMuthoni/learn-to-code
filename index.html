			<h4>
				Nature is man’s teacher. She unfolds her treasures to his search, 
				unseals his eye, illumines his mind, and purifies his heart; an influence breathes from all the sights and sounds of her existence.<br>
				<strong><em>~ Alfred Billings Street</em></strong><br><br>
				It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon men's hearts, as for that subtle something, 
				that quality of air that emanation from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary spirit<br>
				<strong><em>~ Robert Louis Stevenson</em></strong><br>

		<h2 id="deco">Global warming</h2>
		<p>
			Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. 
			It is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.[5][6] Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably.[7] But more accurately, 
			global warming is the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation,[8] while climate change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation.[9] While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming,
			[10] many observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia.<br><br>
			The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded, 
			"It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century".
			[12] The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. 
			Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 °C (0.5 to 3.1 °F) in a moderate scenario, 
			or as much as 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) in an extreme scenario, depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects.
			[13] These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations[14] and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing<br><br>
			The effects of global warming include rising sea levels, regional changes in precipitation, more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, and expansion of deserts.
			[17] Ocean acidification is also caused by greenhouse gas emissions and is commonly grouped with these effects even though it is not driven by temperature. Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic, 
			which has contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Overall, higher temperatures bring more rain and snowfall, but for some regions droughts and wildfires increase instead.[18] Climate change threatens to diminish crop yields, 
			harming food security, and rising sea levels may flood coastal infrastructure and force the abandonment of many coastal cities.
			[19] Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately the environments of coral reefs,[20] mountains, and the Arctic.<br><br>
			Societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects,
			 and possibly climate engineering. Countries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 
			 which entered into force in 1994 and has near-universal membership. The ultimate goal of the convention is to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system".
			 [22] Although the parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required[23] and that global warming should be limited to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) in the Paris Agreement of 2016,
			 [24] the Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by about half this threshold[25] and current pledges by countries to cut emissions are inadequate to limit future warming.

			If we love earth we love every living creature, every single leaf of the trees and evry single person living on it. Point is that nobody understand that love is not strange, frightening or belongs to crazy people.
			You are free to love and understand the miracle of creation.
			Allow yourself to love and you want loose anything, you want be tricked or hurt.
			Because love is creation and creating you can’t ever lose<br><br>
			Stop world drilling oil and gas wells to. Stop mining oil, gas, coal, soil, gravel, sand, stone, salt and ore: This mining has already led to a colossal destruction of the Earth and destruction of Earth’s ecosystems. 
			Flora and fauna suffer from the cruelty of people: Tears and pain nivchem innocent – excruciatingly painful as they suffer it is impossible to live on, otherwise all life will perish from human activities. The effects 
			of extraction of soil, gravel, sand, stone, salt, coal, ore, oil, gas and so on. On the face: the climate changed for the worse, 
			shallowed and dried up rivers and lakes in different parts of the world, the melting of icebergs and the Arctic ocean, earthquakes, hurricanes, acid rain, and snow disfigured and poisoned the land, air and water, various diseases. 
			All living things in the world breathe polluted air, drink the same poisoned water. We are all sick suffer and die painfully slow. Rid of all misery and destruction, for this we need the entire world once and for all to stop the extraction of
			soil, gravel, sand, stone, salt, coal, ore, oil, gas and so on. Life in the world is one, it is mother Earth that created us and other animals and plants. And we all the world should live according to the laws of mother nature, so we can get rid of all disease, suffering, and destruction. 
			From mining salt, coal, ore, oil gas and so on: the Glaciers are melting and climate is changing at a rapid pace. Environmental pollution 
			and the worst environmental disasters in the world are caused by man. We are a child of Nature and we depend on mother Earth, it is better to start taking care of mother Nature. Global industrialization and urbanization has led to global climate change for the worst in the world. To recover and permanently terminate mining of soil, gravel, 
			sand, stone, salt, coal. ore, oil, gas and more. So we can prevent global environmental catastrophe. Between us and other animals plants, there is no difference – we are all children of the Earth and we are all one family. We all the world should live according to the laws of mother Nature and save mother Earth from ecological disaster.

				Welcome to Nature Research. We’re here to serve the research community by publishing the most significant discoveries — findings that advance knowledge and address global societal challenges. Our journals publish not only primary research but also reviews, critical comment and analysis
				<br>
				From weekly journal of science first published in 1869 — to selective subject-specific subscription journals such as Nature Genetics and Nature Physics and broad open-access journals such as Nature Communications and Scientific Reports, there is a home for your research within our family of journals. 
				<br>
				We’re committed to providing more options for authors in the open-access arena too. In early 2018, three new high-quality, selective, open access multidisciplinary journals — Communications Biology, Communications Chemistry and Communications Physics — published their first papers.
				<br>
				Save mother-earth showcase authoritative, accessible and significant reviews content. High-quality graphics and enhanced content provide context and connection whatever your discipline.
				<br>
				We’re proud of our highly trained and critically minded editors, whose broad expertise and connections with their communities ensure that we select scientifically significant papers for publication. And, by using our reach and the nature.com platform, we can deliver our authors’ work to researchers outside their immediate fields — providing readers with access to articles that they didn’t realise would be of interest to them.
